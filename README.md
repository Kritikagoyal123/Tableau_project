**📚 Bookshop Analytics – Tableau Dashboard Project**

This repository contains the final project for MGS 628 – Data Visualization for Business Insights, where our team used Tableau to turn raw data into actionable insights for a fictional bookshop business.

**🗂️ Project Overview**

The goal of this project was to create interactive dashboards and data-driven storyboards that help different stakeholders make strategic decisions using the dataset Bookshop.xlsx.

We applied advanced Tableau techniques including:
	•	Joins and Unions to combine multiple sheets in the dataset
	•	Computed fields (e.g., KPIs, ratios, Boolean expressions)
	•	Parameters, sets, and filter actions
	•	Analytics tools such as reference lines and trendlines


**👥 Stakeholders & Deliverables**

Each team member identified a unique stakeholder (e.g., Marketing Manager, Store Manager, Regional Director) and built storyboards tailored to their needs. Each storyboard consists of at least three interactive dashboards, and each dashboard includes 2–4 visualizations.

Our work includes:
	•	Clear titles and elegant formatting
	•	Descriptive names for worksheets, dashboards, and stories
	•	Use of filter actions, parameters, and sets to enhance interactivity


**📈 Sample Visualizations**

Examples of the dashboards and visualizations we created:
	•	Sales & Profit by Genre and Region
	•	Inventory Turnover by Book Category
	•	Customer Segmentation & Loyalty
	•	Revenue Trends by Store Location
	•	Top-Selling Authors and Seasonal Patterns


**📊 Techniques Used**
	•	Joins/Unions to connect multiple datasets
	•	Custom calculated fields (e.g., profit ratios, conditional flags)
	•	Dynamic dashboards using parameters and sets
	•	Storyboards that connect insights across dashboards


**📄 Report & Collaboration**

Along with the Tableau workbook (.twbx), we submitted a detailed report that included:
	•	Stakeholder-specific decision-making questions
	•	A mapping table of team members, visualizations, and stakeholder roles
	•	Clear attribution of contributions from each team member
